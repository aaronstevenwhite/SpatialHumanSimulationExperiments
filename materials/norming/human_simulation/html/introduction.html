<p>
In this experiment, you will be given sentences with a blank. Your job will be to fill in this blank with the word you think most people would respond with. You should only ever enter a single word, even if it would make sense to enter two or three. 
</p>

<p>
For instance, if you were given the sentence below, you might type the words <i>wrote</i> or <i>sent</i> into the blank. <i>Looked at</i> would also make sense here, but since it is more than one word, you should <u>not</u> use it. Once you fill in the blank, you will press Enter to submit your response.  
</p>

<ul>
<li>The secretary _____ the letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of the sentences you get will have nonsense words in them. For instance, you might get the sentence below. Even though some of the words aren't real words, you should fill in the blank with the (single) <u>real</u> word you think most people would respond with. For instance, like before, you could enter <i>wrote</i> or <i>sent</i> here, but you could also enter <i>hit</i> or <i>kick</i>. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>The blicket _____ the glorp.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of the sentences you see were spoken by someone, so some parts might be missing. For instance, sometimes people ask for a lighter or matches using the sentence below, which should have a <i>you</i> on the front. You should treat these just like the full sentences. That is, if you were to see <i>___ a light?</i>, you should answer with a single real word--e.g. <i>got</i>.  
</p>

<ul>
<li>Got a light?</li>
</ul>

<p>
After some of the sentences, you will be given a memory task. This task will involve choosing from a list the word that actually occurred in the previous sentence. For instance, after seeing <i>The secretary _____ the letter</i>, you might be given the following list.
</p>

<ol>
<li>box</li>
<li>book</li>
<li>letter</li>
<li>clerk</li>
<li>table</li>
</ol>

<p>
In this case, you would choose word 3, since only that word occurs in the sentence. You can indicate your choice either by pressing the number key associated with it or by clicking on the word.
</p>

<p>
The experiment will begin with a practice to get you used to the task. After this, a message will tell you that you are moving on to the experiment.
