you learned how to talk from Mommy and Daddy and hearing other people talk
what'd you hear
I can hear her

what do you hear
I don't hear anybody
I heard him knock on the door

and they can hear and see if we stay around here
did you hear what Janet was telling you

I heard you had a little spider trouble today
I hear somebody at the door
