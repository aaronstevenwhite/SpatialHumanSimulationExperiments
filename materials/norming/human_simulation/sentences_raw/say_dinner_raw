when I got up this morning he said to me
what are you gonna say
that must be what she's trying to say
do you want to say anything more into the microphone
say don't do that Daddy
did you say you wanted him to stay and wait for dessert
I told Mrs Perlow that you could find the c note on the piano pretty good and I said what could I teach you next
let's not say anything else
and she said I wasn't going to say a thing
I wouldn't say that at all
say some more
you can't really say that was a total waste of time
I said she could have mine
and she said the next thing is I think she wants to teach you and in two weeks she wants you to come with Mommy to the piano lesson and she's going to give you a short piano lesson too
you had your chance to have soup and you said you didn't want any more
I was going to tell Wanda what Mrs Perlow said last night
no I meant say what you're saying it's taking you a long time
Katie can you say pru
and I said do we have_to do this anymore and you said no and the next thing I know there was water dripping on my head
he just said it
say you're recording your dinner for David Alderton
let me hear you say it
don't say anything
don't say nothing
say that again
oh it's gonna it's it's recording everything that we say
can you say muffins
well they said hi to me
the only thing that that would be specifically of interest to you is that he said that he said that there is a chance that they might be coming to Boston in the fall
what do you want to say
