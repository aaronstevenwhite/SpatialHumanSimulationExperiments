let's see your face
hey have you seen my plants
what'd you see
o I see
I am going to weigh all the food I eat now just to see if I can lose more by doing that
see those holes
cause I don't see it doesn't mean he ate it
oh I see
you'll see
let's see you think about something
and he took em home but he'll bring them back the next time he comes to see us
let me see how much there is okay
and I saw him munching on Triscuits
I didn't look to see how much
see that's why it would've been nice if you'd taken me seriously when I first started talking
oh I see the evidence
can you see the steam
Mom and I will tape the dinner we have when you and Joan go see the muppets
let me see
see those little thin guys there
I'd like to see a concert
Theresa I don't wanna see it unless you're sitting
see if this is okay
I saw Archie
we haven't seen them for about five years
let me see your back Jen
oh and did you tell Momma the part about where the train is underground and then it comes out and goes over the bridge and you can see the river and the boats
what did you see
Wanda's seen this penny trick
well after seeing that house that Betty last week I just never wanna be in a house like that
