<p>
In this experiment, you'll learn a new word by reading sentences that contain that word. <u>This word is not one you already know.</u> After you've read these sentences, you'll make some judgments about how similar the new word is to words you <u>do</u> already know. For instance, in the first portion of the experiment, you might get the sentence below. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>The secretary blorped the letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After seeing this sentence, you might have some idea what <i>blorp</i> means, but it's probably unclear exactly what: maybe it means something like <i>write</i>, <i>send</i>, <i>read</i>, <i>mail</i>, <i>shred</i>, etc. The next sentence might exclude some of these possibilities.
</p>

<ul>
<li>My mom blorped me a cake recipe.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After reading the second sentence, you might be pretty sure that <i>blorp</i> doesn't mean anything like <i>shred</i> and you might think it's less likely that it means something like <i>write</i> (unless you know the speaker's mom writes her own recipes). But <i>blorp</i> could still mean something like <i>send</i> or <i>mail</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Some of the sentences you get may have some nonsense words in them. For instance, instead of the second sentence above, you might get the following sentence.
</p>

<ul>
<li>My blicket blorped me the flixop.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But even though you don't know what either <i>blicket</i> or <i>flixop</i> mean, you might still be pretty sure that <i>blorp</i> means something like <i>send</i> or <i>mail</i>.
</p>

<p>
The sentences will change on their own after 6 seconds, so make sure to pay attention the entire time; otherwise, you might miss some. After some of the sentences in the first portion of the experiment, you will be given a memory task. This task will involve choosing from a list the word that actually occurred in the previous sentence. For instance, after seeing <i>The secretary blorped the letter</i>, you might be given the following list.
</p>

<ol>
<li>box</li>
<li>book</li>
<li>letter</li>
<li>clerk</li>
<li>table</li>
</ol>

<p>
In this case, you would choose word 3, since only that word occurs in the sentence. You can indicate your choice either by pressing the number key associated with it or by clicking on the word.
</p>

<p>
In the second portion of the experiment, you will be given pairs of words along with a 7-point similarity scale. Your job will be to rate the similarity between the <u>meanings</u> of the two words from <i>very dissimilar</i> (<b>1</b>) to <i>very similar</i> (<b>7</b>).
</p>

<p>
For instance, if you received the words <i>blorp</i> and <i>send</i>, you might respond with a high similarity rating—perhaps a 6 or a 7—since you were pretty sure <i>blorp</i> meant something like <i>send</i>. On the other hand, if you received the words <i>blorp</i> and <i>shred</i>, you might respond with a low similarity rating—perhaps a 1 or a 2—since the second sentence made you think that <i>blorp</i> didn't mean anything like <i>shred</i>.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if you received the two words you already know, like <i>eat</i> and <i>devour</i>, you might respond with a high similarity rating—perhaps a <b>6</b> or a <b>7</b>—since the meanings of <i>eat</i> and <i>devour</i> are quite similar. And if you received the words <i>kill</i> and <i>kiss</i>, you might respond with a low similarity rating—perhaps a <b>1</b> or a <b>2</b>—since the meanings of <i>kill</i> and <i>kiss</i> are quite dissimilar.  
</p>

<p>
The experiment will begin with a short practice to get you used to the task. After this, a message will tell you that you are moving on to the experiment.
